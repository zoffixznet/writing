# Why Am I a "He"? Gender Bias in Tech

This isn't the usual tripe I write about. It's rant, or perhaps just an observation.
"He's just ranting" you may describe this as. And it's this "he" I wish to point out.

I've joined a new online tech community a few months ago. One that knows nothing
about me, other than my gender-ambiguous pen name "Zoffix" I go by. Yet,
I've always been referred to as "he" in conversations. Even referred to as
a "he" in announcements and blog posts. Why is this so? Why am I invariably a "he"?

Back when in [one of my posts](http://blogs.perl.org/users/zoffix_znet/2016/01/why-in-the-world-would-anyone-use-perl-6.html)
where I mentioned one of Perl 6's logo's goals is to discourage misogyny,
I outright got attacked on Reddit for even suggesting the tech community might have
anything to do with pathetically low engagement of half of the human population
in the tech world.

And I bet somewhere—maybe in the actual comments, or maybe offscreen—someone
has said: "he" doesn't know what the hell "he's" talking about.
